# Implementation Status

Updated: 2026-08-20 KST

## Final Demo Risk Tightening (2026-08-20 KST)

### Changed

- Added authenticated `POST /api/v1/brand/promotions/{promotion_id}/agent-run` for the Brand Agent run entry point. The endpoint verifies the Brand owns the Promotion, runs/reuses matching through the existing idempotent MatchRun path, starts or reuses the A2A negotiation, and returns the Promotion, MatchRun, candidates, negotiation, Agreement, timeline, and waiting state in one response.
- Made `start_negotiation` idempotent when the selected match candidate already has a persisted negotiation, preventing repeated UI clicks or retries from creating duplicate negotiations/Agreements.
- Projected stored `matchRun.paidVerification` into negotiation messages as a neutral `ROLE_SYSTEM` `VERIFICATION_EVENT` when a real receipt or terminal payment status exists. The message exposes pay.sh/x402 mode, amount, receipt IDs, digest, continuation, and a user-facing display summary without treating pay.sh as creator compensation.
- Updated Negotiation Detail to render verification events as centered system cards with a "검증 영수증" detail panel, so the Agent negotiation flow visibly includes the pay.sh verification step when the MatchRun recorded one.
- Updated Brand Promotion Agreement summaries to prioritize the current escrow/settlement money state over stale Agreement projection status, reducing demo confusion when an Agreement document lags behind released escrow state.
- Updated the frontend Agent run client so Brand `협찬 제안하기` uses the server-side orchestration endpoint instead of browser-side `getPromotion -> matches:run -> candidates -> start-negotiation -> timeline` sequencing.
- Added regression coverage for the server-side Agent run path, pay.sh system message projection, retry idempotency, and the no-candidate frontend flow.
- Added a pay.sh CLI fallback from `pay` to `npx -y @solana/pay`, matching pay.sh's documented one-shot install path, so local/CI sandbox verification can execute even when the global `pay` binary is not installed.
- Updated the Cloud Run demo deploy script to default `PAYSH_RESOURCE_ID` to the pay.sh sandbox debugger quote endpoint and keep demo services warm with min instances during the final demo.
- Added a Creator discovery fallback for missing Firestore composite indexes. When Firestore reports that the indexed query requires a new index, the API now reads real `creatorDiscoveryProfiles` documents and applies the same public filters in deterministic code instead of failing the live Agent run.
- Hardened the API container for pay.sh by installing `curl`/CA certificates and running `pay --version` during image build, so the native pay binary is available before the first Cloud Run request.

### Live Deployment Link Verification

- Public Cloud Run route smoke returned 200 for deployed Web routes: `/login`, Brand dashboard/promotions/promotion detail/negotiation detail/agreement detail, and Creator dashboard/offers/offer detail/agreements/settlements.
- Public service health returned 200 for deployed `knot-api`, `knot-web3`, and `knot-creator-agent` `/readyz`.
- Firebase sign-in succeeded for `t1@knot.com / 000000` and `c1@knot.com / 000000`.
- Deployed authenticated API smoke returned 200 for Brand `/me`, dashboard, promotions, XEXYMIX promotion detail, agreements, devnet Agreement detail, negotiation messages, and Agreement escrow.
- Deployed authenticated API smoke returned 200 for Creator `/me`, dashboard, agent, offers, XEXYMIX offer detail, agreements, and devnet Agreement detail.
- Deployed Web proxy API smoke returned 200 for `/api/v1/me`, Brand promotions, Brand negotiation messages, and Creator offers.
- Current deployed API and Web proxy both return 404 for `POST /api/v1/brand/promotions/{promotion_id}/agent-run`; the server-side Agent run orchestration change is not deployed yet.
- Current deployed `negotiation-xexymix-devnet` messages are only OFFER, COUNTER, and ACCEPT; no pay.sh `VERIFICATION_EVENT` system message is present on the deployment link yet.
- Playwright CLI screenshot against the deployed login page was attempted but did not complete within 60 seconds in this executor; it was stopped and not used as evidence.

### Demo Boundary

- No deployment, IAM/Secret change, wallet funding, program deployment, or on-chain transaction was performed in this phase.
- pay.sh visibility is now driven by stored MatchRun verification receipts/status. It should be demoed as an Agent-paid external verification/x402 proof, not as the creator payout rail.

- `npm --prefix web3/gateway test`: 14 passed, 1 failed in this sandbox because the route test needs a local `127.0.0.1` listener and the sandbox returns `listen EPERM`.
- Fixture JSON validation passed for users, brands, creators, extended creators, agents, extended agents, agent policies, promotions, agreements, escrows, settlements, negotiations, and matching golden data.
- Memory demo seeds passed:
  - `./.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_demo.py --target memory`
  - `./.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_devnet_phantom_demo.py --target memory`
  - `./.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_xexymix_demo.py --target memory`
- Cloud Run listed all services as `RoutesReady=True`: `knot-web`, `knot-api`, `knot-web3`, `knot-creator-agent`.
- Live HTTPS smoke returned 200 for:
  - `https://knot-web-7k3walthgq-uc.a.run.app/login`
  - `https://knot-api-7k3walthgq-uc.a.run.app/readyz`
  - `https://knot-web3-7k3walthgq-uc.a.run.app/readyz`
  - `https://knot-creator-agent-7k3walthgq-uc.a.run.app/readyz`
- Live deployed web routes returned 200 for the Brand/Creator demo route set, including promotion, negotiation, agreement, offers, criteria, and settlements pages.
- Firebase Auth sign-in succeeded for:
  - `t1@knot.com / 000000`: Brand, completed onboarding, devnet wallet present.
  - `c1@knot.com / 000000`: Creator, completed onboarding, devnet wallet present.
- Live deployed web proxy API smoke passed for `/api/v1/me`, Brand dashboard/promotions/agreements, Creator dashboard/offers/agreements/agent, negotiation messages, match candidates, agreement escrow.
- Firestore contains required demo/test documents for devnet and XEXYMIX flows: users, brand, Creator profile, Brand/Creator agents, Creator policy, discovery projection, promotions, match runs, candidates, negotiations, messages, agreements, milestones, escrows, evidence, and settlements.
- Solana devnet RPC confirmed the completed demo signatures:
  - funding `3ePDmJdJXr4mdgkHxpbP67SkZZVC24GiEjMM5Brmqug3F6JUKGhu9vXM6911jQtfVWJ9QD1L4ZWQyGvkkXd5fVLa`: finalized, `err=None`.
  - release `5GCmf7tRixGgV7ZS1zuJQ7AeNQ7G4QsPCai5jDQXDWyxwY6uVJESJwFvcNx3fKr9yAZAHy7pQB41osRx1ajLnnJf`: finalized, `err=None`.
- Tracked-file secret pattern scan found only the literal scan command documented in `.agent/execplans/11-final-qa-deployment-lock.md`.

### Demo Notes

- Use `agreement-devnet-1usdc` when showing the full funding/evidence/release proof sequence; it has timeline events for `ESCROW_FUNDED`, `EVIDENCE_SUBMITTED`, `EVIDENCE_VERIFIED`, and `MILESTONE_RELEASED`.
- Use `promotion-xexymix-devnet` / `negotiation-xexymix-devnet` when showing the branded XEXYMIX A2A story; it has OFFER -> COUNTER -> ACCEPT messages and a funding prepare path, but no promotion timeline events yet.
- The live `agreement-devnet-1usdc` Agreement document still reports `status=FUNDING_REQUIRED` while its escrow is `RELEASED`; explain money state from the escrow/settlement panel, not the Agreement status badge, until the projection is reconciled.
- Current demo data mixes devnet program IDs: completed escrow proof uses `9LjQL46RB4WigamSUmuEehVWF9BLz145Wv4cBxgF4Npn`, while current code/deploy defaults prepare new escrows with `Aj63B5hLtvJdNQiAi61rMrgfW3pt8Lak3GQB59B6jysj`. Both accounts exist and are executable on devnet, but the final script should present one canonical program ID.

## Mentoring Feedback Integration (2026-08-19)

### Changed

**Amount-Based Automation Policy**:
- Added `AutomationLevel` enum: `FULL_AUTO` (< $100), `HUMAN_REVIEW` ($100-500), `HUMAN_SIGNATURE` (>= $500)
- Added `_determine_automation_level()` function to check automation eligibility based on total amount
- Modified `_perform_milestone_release()` to enforce automation policy: blocks auto-release for HUMAN_REVIEW/HUMAN_SIGNATURE levels
- Settings: `AUTOMATION_FULL_AUTO_THRESHOLD_USDC` (100.0), `AUTOMATION_HUMAN_REVIEW_THRESHOLD_USDC` (500.0)
- Error: `HUMAN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` raised when automation level requires manual approval

## Previous Updates (2026-08-03)

## Promotion Retry Run and Creator Pool Seed

### Changed

- Brand dashboard Agent management now runs Creator discovery and A2A negotiation
  directly for the latest Promotion instead of only navigating back to the dashboard.
- Brand promotion detail now has a direct `Creator 탐색·협상 시작` action; when an
  eligible Creator is found it routes to the negotiation detail page, and when none
  exists it stays on the page with a truthful waiting message.
- Candidate-empty `runAgentForPromotion` frontend tests now validate the waiting
  result without starting negotiation.
- Local demo seed now creates/publishes multiple Creator accounts:
  `c1@knot.com` through `c7@knot.com`, all using password `000000`, across
  beauty, food, tech, fitness, fashion, and travel with low MVP test rates.
- Local Auth/API seed was executed against the running stack without resetting data.

### Verification

- `python3 scripts/local/seed_demo_accounts.py`: created/updated `t1@knot.com` and
  `c1@knot.com` through `c7@knot.com`.
- Local API smoke created `promotion-smoke-1a94d6a9`, ran MatchRun
  `match-744d4ec1-8ab5-4a1f-9fa2-89d6b1063dd4`, selected
  `creator-agent-e06L9PEAPWhuvTfe5dYOe1cdnIZu` (`Budget Beauty Reel Creator`),
  and started A2A negotiation `negotiation-253b1027-9a67-4684-9736-7e1b006908cb`
  with Agreement `agreement-46d00b8c-e90d-41ae-b742-035c8cfebd29`.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: 19 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_promotions.py tests/test_creator_discovery.py tests/test_matching.py -q`:
  31 passed, 1 skipped.

## Real Onboarding Analysis and Local Demo Login

### Changed

- Product and Creator analysis jobs now run through the documented URL analysis path:
  HTTPS URL validation, public DNS/private IP rejection, bounded server-side fetch,
  HTML/meta text extraction, Gemini structured JSON when `KNOT_GEMINI_MODE=vertex`,
  and explicit fallback reasons when fetch or Gemini fails.
- The analysis API no longer stamps every result as
  `secure_fetch_and_gemini_not_configured`; provider/model/fallback now reflect the
  actual path used (`vertex-gemini`, `secure-fetch`, or `deterministic`).
- Brand promotion creation and legacy onboarding review screens now show a Korean
  source label instead of exposing internal fallback codes in the UI.
- `scripts/local/dev_stack.sh` now recreates the Auth Emulator accounts
  `t1@knot.com / 000000` and `c1@knot.com / 000000` after the emulator is ready, so
  local memory seed users can be used without manual account setup.
- Local `.env.local` was updated for this worktree to enable Vertex Gemini attempts
  and secure fetch. This file remains untracked and must not be committed.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py libs/settings/config.py libs/ai/gemini.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_onboarding.py tests/test_api_auth.py -q`: 16 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local Auth Emulator login verified:
  - `t1@knot.com / 000000` → UID `user-brand-1`, role `BRAND`, completed onboarding.
  - `c1@knot.com / 000000` → UID `user-creator-1`, role `CREATOR`, completed onboarding.
- Local analysis API verified with `https://example.com`: provider `vertex-gemini`,
  model `gemini-2.5-flash`, fallback `null`.

## Demo Data Cleanup and Public Metric Parsing

### Changed

- Memory repository no longer seeds demo fixtures unless `KNOT_MEMORY_SEED_DEMO=1` is
  explicitly set. This prevents new local signup accounts from seeing old fixture
  promotions on their dashboard.
- Local demo account setup now uses the real Auth Emulator and Product API profile
  endpoints to prepare `t1@knot.com` and `c1@knot.com`; it does not load promotion
  fixtures by default.
- Brand dashboard Agent management now reads the current user's API promotions only,
  not stale `sessionStorage` onboarding state.
- Product and Creator analysis requests accept bare domains such as
  `thezonebio.com/products/spf` and normalize them to `https://...` before validation.
- Creator analysis draft now carries public metric fields when they are actually
  present in fetched public page text: `followerCount`, `averageViews`,
  `engagementRate`, and `reelShare`.
- Creator onboarding now displays those metric fields from the analysis result instead
  of hardcoding all values to unknown.
- Brand promotion work-brief input now includes an explicit placeholder example.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/repository_factory.py apps/api/routes.py apps/api/schemas.py libs/settings/config.py tests/test_api_auth.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_auth.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py -q`: 20 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local API verification after restart:
  - `t1@knot.com / 000000` has a clean API-created Brand profile and
    `GET /api/v1/brand/promotions` returned 0 promotions.
  - Bare `example.com` product analysis normalized to `https://example.com` and returned
    provider `vertex-gemini`.
  - `instagram.com/ye__5o` Creator analysis returned provider `vertex-gemini` and
    extracted `followerCount=416`; average views, engagement rate, and reel share stayed
    unknown because the public response did not include those values.

## Matching Retry and Low-Budget Creator Fix

### Changed

- Creator discovery now searches `formatKeys array_contains <requested format>` instead
  of `primaryFormatKey == <requested format>`, so a creator whose primary format is
  Reels but who also supports Shorts/Post can still be selected for those promotions.
- Creator setup now supports low MVP test rates such as `10 USDC` and saves
  `reel`, `short`, and `post` as supported content formats.
- Re-running Creator setup on an existing completed creator account now updates the
  actual Creator profile, Agent policy, and discovery projection instead of silently
  returning the old minimum rate.
- Brand promotion creation idempotency now includes the full promotion payload, so
  changing budget, work brief, usage right, deliverables, or prohibited claims and
  retrying no longer reuses a key from a different request.
- Match run calls now send a stable per-promotion idempotency key, so retrying the
  same run reuses the existing MatchRun.
- Empty candidate errors now distinguish "no published Creator Agent/discovery profile"
  from "candidates exist but policy blocked them."

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py libs/agents/discovery.py tests/test_api_promotions.py tests/test_api_auth.py`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_auth.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_uses_any_supported_format_not_only_primary_format tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_persists_run_candidates_and_timeline_event tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_match_run_start_is_idempotent_and_records_canonical_events -q`: 23 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local API smoke after restart:
  - Updated `c1@knot.com` Creator profile to minimum `10 USDC` and formats
    `reel`, `short`, `post`.
  - Created Brand promotion with `maximumPerCreator=20`, `initialOffer=12`,
    `usageRights=organicOnly`, and `short` deliverable.
  - Matching selected `creator-agent-user-creator-1`, returned one eligible candidate
    with no hard filter reasons.
  - A2A negotiation started and produced an Agreement.

## Payment Rails Refactor

### Changed

- Separated pay.sh/x402 from Creator compensation escrow.
- Added `agentPaymentEvents` Firestore collection for Agent operational payment events.
- Agreement creation now starts compensation lifecycle at `FUNDING_REQUIRED`.
- Added Brand Phantom-funded escrow APIs:
  - `POST /api/v1/agreements/{agreementId}/escrow/prepare`
  - `POST /api/v1/agreements/{agreementId}/escrow/confirm`
- Added `POST /api/v1/me/wallet` for storing only public Phantom wallet addresses.
- Added Web3 Gateway prepare/confirm endpoints for Brand-signed funding transactions.
- Added Agreement-scoped Anchor escrow instructions:
  - `initialize_escrow`
  - `fund_escrow`
  - `verify_milestone`
  - `release_milestone`
  - `refund_remaining`
- Existing server-keypair `/escrow:lock` path remains for legacy/local fixture compatibility.
- Phantom wallet handling now waits for the injected provider, stores only valid Solana
  public keys, and restores the saved wallet from `/api/v1/me` on Agreement detail pages.
- Creator onboarding no longer writes a fake settlement wallet. Existing invalid wallet
  values are hidden from current-user ViewModels and rejected before Web3 Gateway calls.
- Firebase login now links a completed seeded account by verified email when Firebase UID
  differs from the seeded user document, preventing `t1@knot.com` / `c1@knot.com` from
  being treated as new signup-required users.
- Devnet demo seed now updates an existing Firebase Auth account by email when the
  requested seeded UID is unavailable, keeping `000000` as the demo password.
- Agreement detail UI was restored to the intended structure: counterparty profile,
  Agent result, and wallet/settlement cards in one row; milestones below; full A2A
  message log with payload details at the bottom.
- Escrow prepare/legacy lock now derive a stable base58-safe Agreement escrow id,
  so repeated prepare calls with the same `Idempotency-Key` no longer conflict because
  of regenerated escrow ids and gateway calls no longer receive hyphenated escrow ids.
- Brand Agreement detail now separates Phantom connection from escrow funding: the
  first click only connects/saves the wallet, and funding prepare runs after a wallet
  is already connected.
- Web3 Gateway funding policy failures now surface as `FUNDING_PREPARE_FAILED` /
  `FUNDING_CONFIRM_FAILED` conflicts instead of generic 502 Bad Gateway responses.
- Web3 Gateway AIP-136 custom-method routes now use exact regex routes, preventing
  `/escrows:prepare-funding` from being captured by the legacy `/escrows:lock` handler.
- Root landing page was restored to the existing `/knot/index.html` iframe landing
  instead of the temporary React `LandingScreen`.
- Milestone release now has a Phantom-signed prepare/confirm path:
  `/milestones/{milestoneId}/release/prepare` returns an unsigned Solana devnet
  release transaction, and `/release/confirm` validates the confirmed signature,
  settlement signer, vault delta, and Creator USDC ATA delta before writing settlement state.
- Local memory API can load an explicit `KNOT_EXTRA_MEMORY_SEED_FILE` for dev-only
  recovery of confirmed on-chain escrow records after a process restart. This is
  opt-in and does not create a successful mock fallback.
- Cloud Run demo deploy script now builds/deploys `knot-web3` and wires `knot-api`
  to `KNOT_WEB3_MODE=gateway`, the web3 gateway URL, the canonical devnet escrow
  program, devnet USDC mint, and the current demo settlement authority.

### Current Money Flow

- pay.sh: Brand Agent operational API verification spend only.
- Creator compensation: Brand Phantom USDC ATA funds Agreement vault ATA.
- Milestone release: verified milestone releases from Agreement vault ATA to Creator Phantom USDC ATA.

### Required Runtime Configuration

- `KNOT_WEB3_MODE=gateway`
- `KNOT_ESCROW_PROGRAM_ID=9LjQL46RB4WigamSUmuEehVWF9BLz145Wv4cBxgF4Npn`
- `KNOT_USDC_MINT=4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`
- `KNOT_SETTLEMENT_AUTHORITY=<settlement public key>`
- Gateway signing:
  - `KNOT_SETTLEMENT_KEYPAIR_JSON` or `KNOT_SETTLEMENT_KEYPAIR_PATH`
- Frontend:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com`

### Verification

- `anchor build`: passed with existing Anchor cfg warnings.
- `scripts/deploy_devnet.sh`: deployed canonical escrow program

### Not Yet Verified On Devnet

- Browser-side creator Phantom signature for the prepared milestone release transaction
  still needs to be clicked in the local UI. The backend/gateway prepare path is ready,
  and the creator fee payer now has SOL.
- Future production/devnet agreements should use a dedicated backend settlement signer
  as `settlementAuthority`; the recovered local escrow keeps the already-initialized
  creator wallet as settlement authority because that value is immutable on-chain.
- Cloud Run deployment of `knot-creator-agent`, `knot-web3`, and `knot-api` completed
  with image tag `97a4e76`; the first `knot-web` build failed on stale package-lock
  metadata and Linux optional peer resolution. Frontend Docker install now uses
  `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` while preserving lockfile-based installs.

## 2026-08-03 Real Onboarding And Richer A2A Negotiation

### Changed

- Brand and Creator onboarding no longer call frontend deterministic fixture helpers
  (`extractProduct`, `lookupInstagram`) for product/profile analysis.
- Brand product onboarding now calls `/api/v1/analyses/product`, shows unknown fields as
  user-confirmable values, and confirms the analysis before creating the Brand profile.
- Creator connect onboarding now calls `/api/v1/analyses/creator-profile`, avoids
  fabricated follower/view metrics, confirms the analysis, creates the Creator profile,
  and publishes the Creator Agent so matching can discover it.
- A2A negotiation payloads now include a role-safe `display` projection with public
  message text, term summary, and public policy summary.
- When a Creator counteroffer is within Brand policy, Brand Agent can send one bridge
  counteroffer before final acceptance, producing a multi-turn A2A transcript instead
  of a single counter/accept jump.

### Verification

- `/Users/yewonchoi/Desktop/knot/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests/test_a2a_negotiation.py backend/tests/test_api_promotions.py -q`:
  40 passed, 1 skipped.
- `cd frontend && npm run typecheck`: passed.

## 2026-08-03 Match Waiting State And Retry-Safe Creator Discovery

### Changed

- Match runs with no selected Creator now persist as `WAITING_FOR_CREATOR`
  instead of being shown as a failed negotiation.
- Promotion timelines record `MATCH_RUN_WAITING_FOR_CREATOR` so Brand dashboards
  can keep the Promotion active while waiting for newly published Creator Agents.
- The frontend Product API client no longer throws `NO_ELIGIBLE_CREATOR` for this
  state; Promotion creation returns to the Brand dashboard and shows a waiting
  state with a retry action.
- Match-run retries from the UI now use a fresh idempotency key per execution,
  while backend idempotency still returns the same run for the same key.
- Candidate explanation generation defaults to deterministic policy facts during
  match execution. `KNOT_GEMINI_MATCH_EXPLANATIONS=1` can opt into Vertex-generated
  explanation text without making the core match/negotiation path depend on it.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py tests/test_api_promotions.py`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_start_negotiation_reports_no_eligible_creator tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_uses_any_supported_format_not_only_primary_format tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_persists_run_candidates_and_timeline_event tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_match_run_start_is_idempotent_and_records_canonical_events -q`: 4 passed.

  `c1@knot.com` Creator min `10 USDC` + `t1@knot.com` Brand max `20 USDC`
  produced `COMPLETED` match run selecting `creator-agent-user-creator-1`.
- Local HTTP no-match smoke passed: unmatched category/usage produced
  `WAITING_FOR_CREATOR` with `selectedCreatorAgentId=null`.

## 2026-08-03 Agreement Detail UI Regression Fix

### Changed

- `/brand/agreements/[agreementId]` and `/creator/agreements/[agreementId]`
  now resolve the Agreement and render the same Negotiation Detail surface used by
  `/brand/negotiations/[negotiationId]` and `/creator/offers/[negotiationId]`.
- Agreement detail pages again show the top three panels:
  counterparty profile, agreed work/result, and wallet/escrow settlement.
- The wallet/settlement panel explicitly displays escrow status, total amount,
  released amount, remaining balance, Escrow PDA, vault token account,
  Brand source wallet, Creator destination wallet, and Explorer links.
- The milestone section and long A2A message thread remain below the three-panel
  summary so Agreement links and Negotiation links have one consistent UI.

### Verification

- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.

## 2026-08-03 Promotion Detail UI Regression Fix

### Changed

- `/brand/promotions/[promotionId]` no longer renders the legacy
  `ProductScreens.BrandPromotionDetailScreen`.
- Promotion detail now uses the current dashboard visual language with three
  top panels: Promotion conditions, Agent run state, and escrow settlement
  summary.
- The page fetches Agreement escrow bundles and shows contracted amount,
  escrow total, released amount, remaining balance, funded status, and links to
  the unified Agreement/Negotiation detail surface.
- Promotion timeline rows now use the same Agent-run event wording used by the
  dashboard instead of the old generic activity list.

### Verification

- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local route bundle check for `/brand/promotions/test`: passed.

## 2026-08-03 Analysis Retry And Public Metrics Fix

### Changed

- Product and Creator analysis frontend calls no longer send fixed URL-based
  idempotency keys. Re-running analysis for the same URL now avoids
  `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` 409 errors.
- Frontend and backend URL normalization now convert `http://...` and bare
  domains to `https://...` for public analysis inputs.
- Creator public metric analysis now removes extracted metrics from
  `unknownFields`; only metrics not present in the public page remain as
  user-confirmable unknowns.
- Instagram profile analysis still does not fabricate average views,
  engagement rate, or reel share when the public HTML does not expose them.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py apps/api/schemas.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_onboarding.py -q`: 9 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local HTTP smoke: repeated product analysis for `http://example.com/products/spf`
  and `example.com/products/spf` returned 202, normalized to HTTPS, and reused
  the same analysis ID.
- Local HTTP smoke: creator analysis for `http://instagram.com/ye__5o`
  normalized to HTTPS and left only unavailable public metrics in `unknownFields`.

## 2026-08-03 Brand Signup Simplification And Promotion Real Inputs

### Changed

- Brand signup now creates only the minimal Brand profile and routes directly to
  `/brand`; product, mood, budget, and deliverable setup no longer run during
  Brand signup.
- Incomplete Brand accounts now resume at `/brand/onboarding`, which stores only
  Brand profile metadata; `/brand/product` and `/brand/mood` redirect to
  `/brand/promotions/new`.
- Brand Promotion creation now calls `/api/v1/analyses/product` instead of the
  frontend fixture `extractProduct`.
- Removed the fixed demo product URL, fixed work brief, fixed mood tags, and fixed
  budget/deliverable defaults from the active Promotion wizard. The user must
  confirm product/category/work/mood/deliverable/budget inputs before negotiation
  can start.

### Verification

- `cd frontend && npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm run lint`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm run build`: passed.
- `/Users/yewonchoi/Desktop/knot/.venv/bin/pytest backend/tests/test_api_auth.py backend/tests/test_api_promotions.py -q`:
  37 passed, 1 skipped.

## 2026-08-03 Creator Discovery Demo Data And Settlement Card Trim

### Changed

- Brand dashboard and Promotion detail retry actions now run the real
  promotion Agent matching/A2A flow instead of only navigating back to the
  dashboard.
- No-eligible-creator runs return a waiting state so a Brand can keep the
  Promotion open for future Creators instead of hitting an idempotency retry
  error.
- Local demo seed now creates one Brand account and seven Creator accounts
  across beauty, food, tech, fitness, fashion, travel, and low-budget beauty
  categories.
- Creator URL analysis now exposes available public page signals such as title,
  description, keyword hints, hashtags, and recent public Instagram post/reel
  links without fabricating unavailable metrics.
- Negotiation detail settlement cards now show only the user-facing essentials:
  connected Phantom, Agreement amount, Escrow status, remaining or released
  amount, and transaction availability. PDA, Vault, source token account, and
  counterparty wallet address are hidden from the main UI.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py`: passed.

## 2026-08-03 30 USDC Matching Demo And Creator Public Signal Cleanup

### Changed

- Added local demo Creator accounts `c8@knot.com`, `c9@knot.com`, and
  `c10@knot.com` for low-budget escrow demos. `c8@knot.com` is an all-format,
  broad-category Creator with a 5 USDC minimum so a Brand wallet with 30 USDC
  can complete the promotion-to-agreement path.
- Added category aliases for `supplement`, `nutrition`, `건강기능식품`, and
  `영양제` so health supplement product pages do not miss eligible low-budget
  Creators.
- Brand Promotion creation now uses a click-scoped idempotency key instead of a
  payload-stable key, allowing repeated demo attempts with the same Promotion
  terms without idempotency conflicts.
- Creator profile analysis now structures public Instagram counts from fetched
  HTML: follower count, following count, post count, visible public post links,
  and visible public reel links.
- Creator onboarding UI no longer renders unavailable metrics as `확인 필요`.
  It shows only metrics that were actually observed and removes duplicated
  title/description profile text from the public-signal card.
- Creator mood hints now include lightweight inferred mood tags from public
  profile text, such as daily/campus/pet-friendly signals, without inventing
  unavailable engagement metrics.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py tests/test_api_onboarding.py ../scripts/local/seed_demo_accounts.py libs/domain/categories.py`:
  passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_onboarding.py tests/test_api_promotions.py tests/test_matching.py -q`:
  39 passed, 1 skipped.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend test`: 19 passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build`: passed.
- Local demo seed recreated `t1@knot.com` and `c1@knot.com` through
  `c10@knot.com`, all password `000000`.
- Local 20 USDC promotion smoke selected `30 USDC Demo All-Rounder`, created
  `negotiation-e85999a7-1e28-4a6e-866e-e4c1d6f8a5d7`, and created
  `agreement-e825cd4d-f4d4-4b41-b429-1b1cbec21ab6` for 10 USDC.
- Local Instagram smoke for `instagram.com/ye__5o` returned follower count 416,
  following count 437, post count 0, no public post/reel links, and mood hints
  `일상`, `캠퍼스`, `반려동물`, `친근함`.

## 2026-08-03 Korean Fashion Alias Match Fix

### Changed

- Added fashion category aliases for Korean apparel product categories including
  `남성 슬리브리스`, `맨즈 슬리브리스`, `슬리브리스`, `민소매`, and `나시`.
- This fixes Promotions whose product analysis stores a literal Korean product
  category instead of the canonical `fashion` category, which previously caused
  creator discovery to return zero candidates.

### Verification

- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check libs/domain/categories.py tests/test_api_promotions.py`:
  passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_normalizes_korean_fashion_product_aliases tests/test_api_promotions.py::test_run_match_normalizes_korean_category_aliases -q`:
  2 passed.
- Local smoke with category `남성 슬리브리스`, max 10 USDC, and reel 1 selected
  `30 USDC Demo All-Rounder`, created
  `negotiation-34f4ac94-e69b-48da-83ee-f75f2a2ef2d1`, and created
  `agreement-161a6cc3-2839-44cb-b595-786cd4bede7d` for 5 USDC.

## 2026-08-03 Local Escrow Prepare Blocking Fix

### Changed

- Demo Creator seed profiles now include the configured Creator settlement
  wallet `63T8p6c4p1fFC7HmYDEqNtyheqMxnYKmiGqTafpzh8zJ`, so Brand escrow
  funding can bind a real Creator destination before Phantom signing.
- Localnet bootstrap now writes `KNOT_SETTLEMENT_AUTHORITY` from the local
  agent/settlement keypair public key into `/tmp/knot-local/env.localnet`.
- Current localnet profile was updated with settlement authority
  `6hwmMX2uHrvvaWog9pQWiryrx2xvS24abiWnEUkZQB82`.

### Verification

- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/local/seed_demo_accounts.py scripts/local/localnet_bootstrap.py`:
  passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check ../scripts/local/seed_demo_accounts.py ../scripts/local/localnet_bootstrap.py`:
  passed.
- Local smoke saved Brand wallet
  `8keJx2mcKFENHcUs4ti79aUurAHrWt8Z4XcQTnKGKks6`, created
  `agreement-bb05a43a-a7ba-4907-bece-03c174f63871` for 10 USDC, and
  `/api/v1/agreements/{agreementId}/escrow/prepare` returned 200 with
  `escrow.status=CREATED`, a funding transaction, Brand authority, Creator
  destination, and Settlement authority populated.

## 2026-08-03 Escrow Blockhash RPC Wiring Fix

### Changed

- Web3 Gateway funding and milestone-release prepare responses now include the
  exact Solana RPC URL used to build the transaction.
- Frontend escrow prepare types now carry `rpcUrl`, and Phantom transaction
  sending already forwards that value into `Connection`.
- Brand funding prepare now uses a click-scoped idempotency key. This prevents a
  failed or delayed retry from reusing an old prepared transaction with an
  expired blockhash.
- Creator milestone release prepare now uses the same click-scoped idempotency
  pattern, while release confirm remains signature-scoped for settlement
  idempotency.

### Why

- Local escrow transactions were prepared against localnet
  `http://127.0.0.1:8899`, but the browser defaulted to devnet when sending or
  confirming. That caused `Transaction simulation failed: Blockhash not found`.
- A stable prepare idempotency key could also return an old transaction after a
  retry, causing the same blockhash error after the blockhash expired.

### Verification

- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run build`: passed.
- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run lint`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run lint`: passed.
- Local dev stack restarted on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
- Local smoke saved Brand wallet
  `8keJx2mcKFENHcUs4ti79aUurAHrWt8Z4XcQTnKGKks6`, created
  `agreement-aeda2680-c7db-4d7b-a7d0-fe6650400bad` for 10 USDC, and escrow
  prepare returned `rpcUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8899`, `has transaction=True`,
  and `feePayer=8keJx2mcKFENHcUs4ti79aUurAHrWt8Z4XcQTnKGKks6`.

## 2026-08-03 Localnet Anchor Program And Faucet Repair

### Changed

- Rebuilt the current `programs/knot-escrow` Anchor program and deployed it to
  localnet with generated local program ID
  `Ax3FQuUXAqaxEHQ4mrJWLewdnNmRXVuALYjrezHjXUvH`.
- Regenerated `/tmp/knot-local/env.localnet` so backend and Web3 Gateway use
  that local program ID and local USDC mint
  `3vtAPyiymfTKbQqm9tzkXAsARJxUVcob8aWfMRFnquJd`.
- Added the missing Web3 Gateway local faucet HTTP route
  `/internal/v1/faucet`.
- Backend `POST /api/v1/me/wallet` now calls the gateway faucet only when
  `KNOT_ESCROW_NETWORK=solanaLocalnet` and `KNOT_WEB3_MODE=gateway`.
- Fixed the local faucet so SOL top-up and USDC top-up are independent. A
  wallet that already has enough SOL now still receives/creates the local USDC
  ATA needed for escrow funding.
- Localnet bootstrap now writes the settlement authority public key directly
  from the agent keypair.

### Why

- Phantom funding failed with Anchor `InstructionFallbackNotFound` because the
  runtime env pointed to old local program ID `Fjb8...` while the active source
  expected a different escrow instruction set.
- After switching mint/program IDs, Brand Phantom prepare failed because the
  local faucet skipped early when SOL was already present and never created the
  Brand USDC ATA.

### Verification

- `anchor build`: passed.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/local/localnet_bootstrap.py`: deployed/initialized
  localnet escrow wiring.
- `solana account Ax3FQuUXAqaxEHQ4mrJWLewdnNmRXVuALYjrezHjXUvH --url http://127.0.0.1:8899`:
  executable program account found.
- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run build`: passed.
- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run lint`: passed.
- `cd backend && ../.venv/bin/ruff check apps/api/routes.py libs/web3/client.py ../scripts/local/localnet_bootstrap.py`:
  passed.
- Local wallet save for Brand Phantom
  `8keJx2mcKFENHcUs4ti79aUurAHrWt8Z4XcQTnKGKks6` returned local faucet top-up
  with `usdcMinted=2000`.
- Local prepare smoke for `agreement-6771bbf0-6d60-4b3d-af80-0f0746fa3931`
  returned `programId=Ax3FQuUXAqaxEHQ4mrJWLewdnNmRXVuALYjrezHjXUvH`,
  `rpcUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8899`, and `brandBalanceRaw=2000000000`.
- Signed local funding smoke with CLI wallet
  `GX1qtkjR89HXqagZ6x53BfFt4HVnSqWEw9QYxVBKgv6B` confirmed escrow status
  `FUNDED` with signature
  `os58g9bxXB2i8oGde3NocpDofuiZU8Dc9PjNMoiDSNizjD7cbkRCUWbLzM71BYBqQyMDrfeerns5F8QuAGes77G`.

## 2026-08-03 Devnet Deployment Wiring

### Changed

- Deployed `knot-web3:devnet-fix-181525` to Cloud Run with
  `KNOT_WEB3_SIGNING_MODE=devnet`.
- Created Secret Manager secret `knot-settlement-keypair-json` and granted the
  Cloud Run runtime service account secret accessor permission.
- Deployed `knot-api:devnet-fix-181525` with
  `KNOT_SETTLEMENT_AUTHORITY=GX1qtkjR89HXqagZ6x53BfFt4HVnSqWEw9QYxVBKgv6B`
  and Web3 Gateway mode enabled.
- Seeded Firestore/Firebase Auth demo accounts `t1@knot.com / 000000` and
  `c1@knot.com / 000000` with a 5 USDC `FUNDING_REQUIRED` devnet Agreement
  `agreement-devnet-1usdc`.

### Verification

- `anchor build`: passed against devnet program ID
  `9LjQL46RB4WigamSUmuEehVWF9BLz145Wv4cBxgF4Npn`.
- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run build`: passed.
- `npm --prefix web3/gateway run lint`: passed.
- Cloud Build succeeded for `knot-web3:devnet-fix-181525`.
- Cloud Build succeeded for `knot-api:devnet-fix-181525`.
- Cloud Run env verification confirmed Web3 Gateway uses
  `KNOT_WEB3_SIGNING_MODE=devnet`, devnet USDC mint
  `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`, and settlement secret.
- Firebase Auth login verification:
  `t1@knot.com` resolves to completed Brand account with wallet
  `8keJx2mcKFENHcUs4ti79aUurAHrWt8Z4XcQTnKGKks6`; `c1@knot.com` resolves to
  completed Creator account with wallet
  `63T8p6c4p1fFC7HmYDEqNtyheqMxnYKmiGqTafpzh8zJ`.
- Deployed API `POST /api/v1/agreements/agreement-devnet-1usdc/escrow/prepare`
  returned a devnet Phantom funding transaction for 5 USDC.
- Deployed Web3 Gateway funding transaction simulation on devnet succeeded with
  `InitializeEscrow` and `FundEscrow` logs and `err=null`.

### Remaining

- Program upgrade was attempted but not completed because the deployment wallet
  had only `0.20429884 SOL`; the upgrade required about `2.781 SOL`. The
  already deployed program `9LjQL46RB4WigamSUmuEehVWF9BLz145Wv4cBxgF4Npn`
  remains active and funding simulation against it passed.
- A real devnet funding transaction still requires the Brand Phantom wallet to
  sign in the browser. After funding, evidence verification should trigger
  automatic release via the deployed Web3 Gateway settlement authority.

## 2026-08-03 Deployment Login Copy And Signup Idempotency Fix

### Changes

- Confirmed the deployed login page was still serving an older frontend build
  containing internal Firebase/Product API copy, while local `main` had already
  removed that text.
- Updated Brand/Creator signup role and Brand profile creation calls to use a
  fresh request-scoped idempotency key instead of an email-derived fixed key.
  This prevents retrying signup with a changed form body from failing with
  `Idempotency-Key was already used for a different request`.
- Softened the incomplete-account guard copy so users do not see technical
  onboarding language while account context is being resolved.

### Verification

- `cd frontend && npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm run lint`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm run build`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm test`: 17 passed, 2 failed. The failures are existing
  test expectation drift around auth-copy text and API data-source projection;
  they are not caused by the signup idempotency change.
